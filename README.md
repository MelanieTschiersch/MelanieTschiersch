- 👋 Hi, I’m @MelanieTschiersch, a PhD student in Barcelona
- 👀 I’m interested in computational neuroscience, working memory, serial dependence and synaptic plasticity. Basically how we can explain behavior through neural recordings and understanding the underlying neural mechanisms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with working memory across brain regions
